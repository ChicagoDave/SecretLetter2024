### Jack Toresal and The Secret Letter

In 2009 Textfyre published its first Interactive Fiction story game using Microsoft Silverlight.

That technology has long been abandoned, but a new comopany has created a replacement technology called OpenSilver.

This repo is the adapted version of Secret Letter.

As of March 11, 2024 it compiles but only shows a blank screen.
